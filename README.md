# PLP AI Week 8 - AI Agents Assignment

This repository contains the full write-up and supporting assets for the "AI Agents" assignment. Deliverables include:

- `docs/assignment.md` - Section 1 short answers (five prompts, 150-200 words each) and Section 2 case study analysis (400-800 words) covering AutoParts Inc.'s smart manufacturing strategy.
- `simulations/n8n-smart-manufacturing.json` - n8n workflow blueprint that simulates the Sentinel quality-control agent's remediation loop, ready for import into n8n or Make.com equivalents.

## Quick start

1. Read `docs/assignment.md` for the narrative submission.
2. Import the JSON under `simulations/` into your n8n instance (or inspect the file directly on GitHub) to reproduce the automation scenario referenced in Section 2.
3. Update or extend the workflow by editing the JSON and re-exporting from n8n if you run additional experiments.

The exported workflow is tracked in version control and accessible via the repository link:
